Tracking trending GitHub repositories and posting them on Weibo. Inspired by [scuttlebutt](https://github.com/benbjohnson/scuttlebutt).

It works by using the Twitter Search API to find mentions of "github.com" URLs and then uses the GitHub API to extract repository information.

[Mercury][] is a major Roman god, being one of the Dii Consentes within the ancient Roman pantheon. He is the patron god of financial gain, commerce, eloquence (and thus poetry), __messages/communication__ (including divination), travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery and thieves; he is also the guide of souls to the underworld.
